**Last Updated: 26 January 2025**

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the 1238 Last War Discord Bot (“the Bot”) collects, uses, stores, and shares information when you use its features on the Discord platform. By using the Bot, you acknowledge and agree to the practices outlined in this Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

1.1 **User Data**  
- **Discord ID and Username**: We collect these to identify users within the server and manage role assignments.  
- **Display Name and Alliance Details**: The Bot parses user display names to assign appropriate roles and track alliance-related information.  
- **Messages and Reports**: The Bot may log reports and certain messages used for moderation or administrative purposes (e.g., violation reports).

1.2 **Attachments and Images**  
- **Uploaded Screenshots**: If you submit a screenshot for a report, the Bot stores a reference (URL) to the image hosted by Discord for moderation review.

1.3 **Logs**  
- **Action Logs**: We track role changes and significant in-app events (e.g., alliance creation, user registration). These logs may contain timestamps and user information.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

2.1 **Server Moderation and Administration**  
- **Role Assignments**: The Bot uses your display name and alliance details to grant or remove specific roles.  
- **Report Management**: Submitted reports (including descriptions and attachments) are used to investigate potential rule breaches or alliance infractions.

2.2 **Improving User Experience**  
- **Automation**: Automating rank or alliance checks helps maintain a consistent user experience and streamline server administration.  
- **Analytics**: We may use aggregated data to understand Bot performance and usage trends.

2.3 **Communications**  
- **Notifications**: The Bot may send notifications (e.g., direct messages about report outcomes) to keep you informed of moderation decisions or updates.

## 3. Data Retention

3.1 **Log Retention**  
The Bot automatically purges certain logs (e.g., moderation logs) after a set period (currently 14 days) to reduce the amount of stored personal data.

3.2 **Long-Term Storage**  
- **User Profiles, Alliances, and Reports**: Data needed for ongoing moderation or administrative purposes (e.g., records of past violations) may be stored indefinitely unless a valid deletion request is received.

3.3 **Deletion Upon Request**  
Users may request the removal of personal data by contacting a server administrator. Please note that minimal information may remain if required for legitimate moderation purposes or compliance with Discord’s policies.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

4.1 **Within the Discord Server**  
- **Server Staff Access**: Administrators, moderators, and Bot developers may access your data to manage the server, respond to reports, or perform technical troubleshooting.

4.2 **Third Parties**  
- **Discord**: Messages and attachments are primarily stored on Discord’s platform. We do not share your data with third parties beyond what is necessary for Bot functionality.  
- **No Unauthorised Sharing**: We will not sell or share your personal information with external parties for advertising or marketing.

6.2 **User Responsibility**  
You are responsible for securing your own Discord account and exercising caution when sharing personal details online.
